      "story": "I first met the missionaries when they visited my grandmother. I was only sitting in the kitchen doing homework, but something about their message felt familiar. After a few weeks of lessons, I prayed for the first time in years and felt overwhelming peace. I was baptized three months later, and my family followed soon after."

      "story": "I grew up without religion, but when I moved for college, two missionaries approached me near campus. I normally avoided conversations about faith, but something pushed me to listen. The message about eternal families resonated deeply with me. I was baptized that same year and later served a mission myself."
